### Section 0: Planning and Defining

Key aspects of the software development life cycle (SDLC):
 - deciding if the project is worth doing
 - determining the required capabilities
 - designing and writing the code
 - testing to make sure it works
 - deploying and maintaining the software

Planning phase:
 - beginning of the SDLC
 - establish the project's vision and scope
 - establish goals and timeframe
 - assess feasibility and business case
 - essentially determine if the project is worth doing

Implementation details should not yet be included in this phase as they depend on design decisions that come later in the process.

Types of expertice required:
 - software engineers
 - hardware engineers
 - finance
 - management/human resources
 - law experts/lawyers

Developing a business case:
 - problem statement: identify the need or opportunity
 - proposed solution: outline the recommended approach
 - market analysis: describe who the effort will serve in the competitive landscape
 - estimated costs: forecast the money and other resources required
 - return on investments (ROI): estimate the project's benefits to organisation

Defining phase:
 - a common approach is to define major requirements (called epics)
 - these are then broken down into user stories (descriptions of possible use/task)
 - discover anc capture stories by reading product reviews of existing products, holding focus groups with proxy customers and observing how users interact with similar systems.
