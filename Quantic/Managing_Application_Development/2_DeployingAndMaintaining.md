### Section 2: Deploying and Maintaining

Deploying:
 - The deployment phase is where the team publishes the software or rolls out changes, and the system goes live.
 - Before publishing, the app is passed through several environments to make sure it works.
 - An environment is a set of computers on which the system is run and tested.
 - Any new code (and debuggin/testing) is done in a development environment which users don't have access to.
 - The staging environment emulates the live version of the app (for testing the overall system).
 - When code goes live, it moves to the production environment (the one that users interact with when using an app).

Maintaining:
 - While the app is live, one will receive bug reports, user reviews and new requirements.
 - To maintain the software in light of these new events, we go back to the SDLC.
