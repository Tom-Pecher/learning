## Managing Application Development
### Section 1: Designing, Building and Testing

Designing:
 - involves planning our how we will create the system to meet the requirements
 - consider whether to use open-source software (OSS), which can save time and money
 - however building parts yourself gives more control

Building:
 - to ensure that code is verified while its being written, we may use pair programming
 - this results in better team cohension (improve technical skills all round) and fewer bugs but takes longer
 - likewise, code review is necessary to catch errors whilst encouraging dialogue

Testing:
 - testing may take a lot of time but is critical to a successful project
 - unit testing tests individual units of code in isolation
 - integration testing tests how related components work together
 - system testing tests the overall system
 - in-house tests should be automated as much as possible
 - test the system with proxy customers or realse to a limited number of customers before general release
