// Section 34: Array Const

// An array declared with const cannot be reassigned:
const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

// It does not define a constant array. It defines a constant reference to an array:
cars[0] = "Toyota";

// An array declared with const must be initialized when it is declared.
// An array with const has block scope.
