// Section 58: Bitwise Operators

// JavaScript Bitwise Operators:
//  & 	    AND 	                Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
//  | 	    OR 	                    Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
//  ^ 	    XOR 	                Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
//  ~ 	    NOT 	                Inverts all the bits
//  << 	    Zero fill left shift 	Shifts left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
//  >> 	    Signed right shift 	    Shifts right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
//  >>> 	Zero fill right shift 	Shifts right by pushing zeros in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off
