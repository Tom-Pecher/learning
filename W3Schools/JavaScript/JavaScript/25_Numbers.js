// Section 25: Numbers


// JavaScript has only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without decimals.
let a = 3.14;
let b = 3;

// Using scientific notation:
let x = 123e5;
let y = 123e-5;

// JavaScript will return NaN for numbers that are impossible:
let test = 100 / "Apple";
isNaN(test);
typeof NaN;

// JavaScript will return Infinity for numbers that are too large:
while (myNumber != Infinity) {
    myNumber = myNumber * myNumber;
}
let inf =  2 / 0;

// Hexadecimal numbers are written with a leading 0x:
let hex = 0xFF;
