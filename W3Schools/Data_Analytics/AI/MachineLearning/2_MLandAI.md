## Notes
Artificial intelligence is hard to define since we cannot even agree on what intelligence is. In its broadest definition, AI is the study of how simple systems can produce complex behaviour.

It is generally agreed upon that all AI we have currently is Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI, also called weak AI), meaning that the AI is built for a specific task and cannot solve problems outside of that task. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI, or strong AI) is AI that can solve problems outside of what it was trained to do.
