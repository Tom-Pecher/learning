## Notes
Conventional programming uses data and algorithms to come to results. In ML (supervised learning), we use data and results to come to algorithms.

A perceptron is a single unit of a neural network, known as a neuron. Neural networks are multilayer perceptrons. Neural networks have an input layer, output layer and hidden layer(s). A deep neural network is one with several hidden layers.
