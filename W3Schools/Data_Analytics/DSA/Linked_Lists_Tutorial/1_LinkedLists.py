# Section 1: Linked Lists

# Linked lists are a data structure consisting of nodes that are linked together to form a sequence.

# Comparison of Arrays and Linked Lists:                                                                            ARRAYS 	LINKED LISTS
    # An existing data structure in the programming language 	                                                     Yes 	 No
    # Fixed size in memory 	                                                                                         Yes 	 No
    # Elements, or nodes, are stored right after each other in memory (contiguously) 	                             Yes 	 No
    # Memory usage is low (each node only contains data, no links to other nodes) 	                                 Yes 	 No
    # Elements, or nodes, can be accessed directly (random access) 	                                                 Yes 	 No
    # Elements, or nodes, can be inserted or deleted in constant time, no shifting operations in memory needed. 	 No      Yes
