# KEY TERMS
    # Algorithm 	        A set of step-by-step instructions to solve a specific problem.
    # Data Structure 	    A way of organizing data so it can be used efficiently.
    # Time Complexity 	    A measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to run, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
    # Space Complexity 	    A measure of the amount of memory an algorithm uses, depending on the amount of data the algorithm is working on.
    # Big O Notation 	    A mathematical notation that describes the limiting behavior of a function when the argument tends towards a particular value or infinity.
    # Recursion 	        A programming technique where a function calls itself.
    # Divide and Conquer 	A method of solving complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, solving the sub-problems, and combining the solutions.
    # Brute Force 	        A simple and straight forward way an algorithm can work by simply trying all possible solutions and then choosing the best one.
