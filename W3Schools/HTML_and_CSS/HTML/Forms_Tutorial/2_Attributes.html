<!-- The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted: -->
<form action="/action_page.php">
    <label for="fname">First name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname" value="John"><br>
    <label for="lname">Last name:</label><br>
    <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname" value="Doe"><br><br>
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 

<!-- The method attribute specifies the HTTP method to be used when submitting the form data: -->
<form action="/action_page.php" method="get"> 
<!-- 
    Notes on GET:
     - Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
     - NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
     - The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
     - Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
     - GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

    Notes on POST:
     - Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
     - POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
     - Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
 -->

<!-- The autocomplete attribute specifies if values should be autocompleted based on previously entered information: -->
<form action="/action_page.php" autocomplete="on">

<!-- The novalidate attribute specifies if the entered data should be validated: -->
<form action="/action_page.php" novalidate>
