<!-- 
    A web worker is a JavaScript that runs in the background, independently of other scripts, without affecting the performance of the page.
    You can continue to do whatever you want: clicking, selecting things, etc., while the web worker runs in the background.
 -->
<!-- 
    Since web workers are in external files, they do not have access to the following JavaScript objects:
        The window object
        The document object
        The parent object
