<!-- 
  XHTML stands for EXtensible HyperText Markup Language
  XHTML is a stricter, more XML-based version of HTML
  XHTML is HTML defined as an XML application
  XHTML is supported by all major browsers
 -->

<!-- 
  Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.
  A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.
  A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:
    scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename 
 -->

<!-- 
  Important differences in XHTML:
    - <!DOCTYPE> is mandatory
    - The xmlns attribute in <html> is mandatory
    - <html>, <head>, <title>, and <body> are mandatory
    - Elements must always be properly nested
    - Elements must always be closed
    - Elements must always be in lowercase
    - Attribute names must always be in lowercase
    - Attribute values must always be quoted
    - Attribute minimization is forbidden
