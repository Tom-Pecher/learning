<!-- 
  A URL is another word for a web address.
  A URL can be composed of words (e.g. w3schools.com),
  or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50).
 -->

<!-- 
  Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.
  A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.
  A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:
    scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename 
 -->

<!-- 
  Common URL schemes:
    http 	  HyperText Transfer Protocol 	        Common web pages (Not encrypted)
    https 	Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol 	  Secure web pages (Encrypted)
    ftp 	  File Transfer Protocol 	              Downloading or uploading files
    file 	  A file on your computer
 -->

<!-- 
  URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII set, the URL has to be converted.
  URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
  URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
  URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.
