<!DOCTYPE html>

    <!-- 
        The <hr> tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
        The <hr> element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
     -->
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p>This is some text.</p>
<hr>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>
<hr> 

     <!-- 
        Use <br> if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
     -->
<p>This is<br>a paragraph<br>with line breaks.</p> 

     <!-- 
        Regular text in HTML is usually presented without whitespace. 
        To preserve the structure of a piece of text use preformated text:
     -->
<pre>
   Potato
 
   Potatoo
 
   Potatooo
</pre> 

</html>
