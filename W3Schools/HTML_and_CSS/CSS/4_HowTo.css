/* 
    There are 3 ways to insert CSS:
     - External CSS: loading an external CSS file into HTML
     - Internal CSS: using the <style> element in the <head> section
     - Inline CSS: using the style attribute in HTML elements
*/

    All the styles in a page will "cascade" into a new "virtual" style sheet by the following rules, where number one has the highest priority:
        1. Inline style (inside an HTML element)
        2. External and internal style sheets (in the head section)
        3. Browser default
