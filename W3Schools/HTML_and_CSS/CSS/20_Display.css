/* Section 20: Display */


/* The display property is used to change the default display behavior of HTML elements. */

/* A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. */
/* 
    Example of block level elements:
        <div>
        <h1> - <h6>
        <p>
        <form>
        <header>
        <footer>
        <section>
*/

/* An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. */
/* 
    Examples of inline elements:
        <span>
        <a>
        <img>
*/

/* 
    The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element in the following ways:
        inline          	Displays an element as an inline element
        block 	            Displays an element as a block element
        contents 	        Makes the container disappear, making the child elements children of the element the next level up in the DOM
        flex 	            Displays an element as a block-level flex container
        grid 	            Displays an element as a block-level grid container
        inline-block 	    Displays an element as an inline-level block container. The element itself is formatted as an inline element, but you can apply height and width values
        inline-flex 	    Displays an element as an inline-level flex container
        inline-grid 	    Displays an element as an inline-level grid container
        inline-table 	    The element is displayed as an inline-level table
        list-item 	        Let the element behave like a <li> element
        run-in 	            Displays an element as either block or inline, depending on context
        table 	            Let the element behave like a <table> element
        table-caption 	    Let the element behave like a <caption> element
        table-column-group 	Let the element behave like a <colgroup> element
        table-header-group 	Let the element behave like a <thead> element
        table-footer-group 	Let the element behave like a <tfoot> element
        table-row-group 	Let the element behave like a <tbody> element
        table-cell 	        Let the element behave like a <td> element
        table-column 	    Let the element behave like a <col> element
        table-row 	        Let the element behave like a <tr> element
        none 	            The element is completely removed
        initial 	        Sets this property to its default value
        inherit 	        Inherits this property from its parent element

/* If we wish to hide an element but still keep the space where the element used to be: */
