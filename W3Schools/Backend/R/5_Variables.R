# R: W3Schools - Main Tutorial
# Section 5: Variables

# Variables are assigned with the assignment operator <- :
name <- "John"
age <- 40

# We can concatenate variables with the paste() function:
text <- "awesome"
paste("R is", text)

# We can assign multiple variables in one line:
var1 <- var2 <- var3 <- "Orange"
