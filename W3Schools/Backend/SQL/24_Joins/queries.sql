-- Section 24: Joins

-- Joins are used to combine the contents of multiple tables:
    -- (INNER) JOIN:        Returns records that have matching values in both tables
    -- LEFT (OUTER) JOIN:   Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
    -- RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN:  Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
    -- FULL (OUTER) JOIN:   Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
