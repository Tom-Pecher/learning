// Section 3: Syntax

// Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class:
public class Main {
    // The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // We can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen:
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
