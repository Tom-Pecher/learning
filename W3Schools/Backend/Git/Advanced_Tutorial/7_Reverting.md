## Section 7: Reverting

Revert is the command we use when we want to take a previous commit and add it as a new commit, keeping the log intact.

### Basic Git Commands:
| Command | Action |
| git log --oneline | show all logs on as single lines |
| git revert HEAD --no-edit | revert the latest change,  and then commit, (--no-edit to skip the commit message editor) |
