## Section 4: Git Ignore

When sharing your code with others, there are often files or parts of your project, you do not want to share.

Examples
 - log files
 - temporary files
 - hidden files
 - personal files

### Basic Git Commands:
| Command | Action |
| touch .gitignore | create a .gitignore file |

The rules for matching patterns in .gitignore files are extensive and should be searched up when required.
