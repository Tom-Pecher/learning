## Section 3: New Files

### Basic Git Commands:
| Command | Action |
| git status | shows status of all files |

Files in your Git repository folder can be in one of 2 states:

    Tracked - files that Git knows about and are added to the repository
    Untracked - files that are in your working directory, but not added to the repository

 When you first add files to an empty repository, they are all untracked. To get Git to track them, you need to stage them, or add them to the staging environment.
