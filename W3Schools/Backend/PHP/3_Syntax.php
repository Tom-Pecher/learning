<?php
// In PHP, keywords (e.g. if, else, while, echo, etc.), classes, functions, and user-defined functions are not case-sensitive:
ECHO "Hello World!<br>";
echo "Hello World!<br>";
EcHo "Hello World!<br>";

// However; all variable names are case-sensitive:
$color = "red";
echo "My car is " . $color . "<br>";
?>
