<!-- 
    FLWOR stands for:
        For         - selects a sequence of nodes
        Let         - binds a sequence to a variable
        Where       - filters the nodes
        Order by    - sorts the nodes
        Return      - what to return (gets evaluated once for every node)
-->

<!-- The following will select all titles of books with a price of 30+: -->
doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book[price>30]/title 

<!-- The following FLWOR expression will do the same thing: -->
for $x in doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book
where $x/price>30
return $x/title

<!-- We may also choose to sort the titles alphabetically: -->
for $x in doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book
where $x/price>30
order by $x/title
return $x/title
