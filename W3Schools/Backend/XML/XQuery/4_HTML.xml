<!-- We may take our result from before and present it as a HTML list: -->
<ul>
{
for $x in doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book/title
order by $x
return <li>{$x}</li>
}
</ul> 

<!-- However, this will keep the "title" element for each line. To get to the data, we can use data(): -->
<ul>
{
for $x in doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book/title
order by $x
return <li>{data($x)}</li>
}
</ul>
