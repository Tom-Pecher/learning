<!-- To loop a specific number of times in a for clause, you may use the to keyword: -->
for $x in (1 to 5)
return <test>{$x}</test>

<!-- The at keyword can be used to count the iteration: -->
for $x at $i in doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book/title
return <book>{$i}. {data($x)}</book> 

<!-- It is also allowed with more than one in expression in the for clause: -->
for $x in (10,20), $y in (100,200)
return <test>x={$x} and y={$y}</test>

<!-- Use let for variable assignment: -->
let $x := (1 to 5)
return <test>{$x}</test> 

<!-- Use where to specify more the one criterion for the result: -->
where $x/price>30 and $x/price<100

<!-- The order by clause is used to specify the sort order of the result. Here we want to order the result by category and title: -->
for $x in doc("books.xml")/bookstore/book
order by $x/@category, $x/title
return $x/title
