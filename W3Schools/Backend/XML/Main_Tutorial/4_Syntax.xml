<!-- 
XML Syntax Rules:
    - XML documents must contain one root element that is the parent of all other elements
    - The prologue (specifying the version and charset) is optional, but must be put at the start of the document if included.
    - All XML elements must have a closing tag.
    - XML tags are case sensitive.
    - XML elements must be properly nested (one inside the other, rather than overlapping).
    - XML attribute values must be quoted.
    - Special characters (like <, >, &, and ") must be escaped.
    - White space is preserved in XML elements (not truncated as in HTML).
    - Comments (such as this one) should be included to improve readability.
