<!-- Section 6: Attributes -->

<!-- Attributes contain data related to a specific element: -->
<person gender="female">

<!-- Attributes most be quoted. -->
<!-- If an attribute contains quotes, we can use the opposite quotes like so: -->
<gangster name='George "Shotgun" Ziegler'>

<!-- Or we can use character entities: -->
<gangster name="George &quot;Shotgun&quot; Ziegler">

<!-- 
    Elements and attributes both contain data. However:
        - attributes cannot contain multiple values (elements can)
        - attributes cannot contain tree structures (elements can)
        - attributes are not easily expandable (for future changes)
    Hence, attributes are often used to store data that is not part of the actual content.
