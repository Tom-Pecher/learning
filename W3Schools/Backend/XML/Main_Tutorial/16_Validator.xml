<!-- Section 16: Validator -->

<!-- An XML document with correct syntax is called "Well Formed". -->
<!-- The syntax rules were described in the previous chapters. -->

<!-- A "valid" XML document must be well formed. In addition, it must conform to a document type definition. -->
<!-- 
  There are two different document type definitions that can be used with XML:
      DTD         - The original Document Type Definition
      XML Schema  - An XML-based alternative to DTD

A document type definition defines the rules and the legal elements and attributes for an XML document.

<!-- W3Schools has an XML validator to perform syntax checks. -->
