<!-- 
The XML language has no predefined tags.
The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. 
These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.
HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.
