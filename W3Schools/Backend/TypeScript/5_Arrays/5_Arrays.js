// TypeScript: W3Schools - Main Tutorial
// Section 5: Arrays
// TypeScript has a specific syntax for arrays. It is similar to JavaScript, but with a few differences:
var names1 = [];
names1.push("Dylan");
// The readonly keyword is used to make the array immutable. This means that you cannot add, remove, or change elements in the array:
var names2 = ["Dylan"];
// NOTE: TypeScript will infer the type of the array if you initialize it with values.
