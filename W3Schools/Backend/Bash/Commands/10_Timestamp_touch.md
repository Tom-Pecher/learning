### Section 10: Timestamp (touch)

The "touch" (timestamp) command will create an empty file if it does not already exist or update its timestamp if it does.

Options:
    -a                           Update only when the file was last read.
    -m                           Update only when the file was last changed.
    -t                           Set the timestamp to a specific time.
    -c                           Do not create any files.
