// BASICS
    // Here is a breakdown of the functioanlity of each line:
#include <iostream>               // Import functionailty from a header file to work with input and output objects.
using namespace std;              // Allows us to use actual names for objects from the standard library (else we would have to prefix them with std::___).

int main() {                      // The main function, what is called when the file is run.
  cout << "Hello World!" << endl; // The string is inserted into the output object, printing it to the console.
  return 0;                       // The function must return an integer so this ends the function (return 0 means it ran successfully).
}
