# TYPES
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex


# INTEGERS
    # Integers are whole numbers of unlimited length:
i1 = 1
i2 = 35656222554887711
i3 = -3255522


# FLOATS
    # Floating-point numbers are decimal numbers:
f1 = 1.10
f2 = 1.0
f3 = -35.59


# COMPLEX
    # Complex numbers are the sum of two integers/floats where one has an imaginary part:
c1 = 3+5j
c2 = 5j
c3 = -5j


# RANDOM
    # We can generate random numbers in a variety of ways using the methods in the "random" module:
import random
print(random.randrange(1, 10))
