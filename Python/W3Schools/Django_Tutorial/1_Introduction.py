# Section 1: Introduction

# Django is a Python framework that makes it easier to create web sites using Python.
# Django follows the MVT design pattern (Model View Template):
    # Model     - The data you want to present, usually data from a database.
    # View      - A request handler that returns the relevant template and content - based on the request from the user.
    # Template  - A text file (like an HTML file) containing the layout of the web page, with logic on how to display the data.
